Abstract: <br><br>
Feature pyramids have proven to be useful in extracting feature maps at multiple scales. Similarly, dilated residual networks have the capability to produce high resolution feature maps with fewer parameters. In this work, we leverage the power of both feature pyramids, and dilated residual networks. To benchmark our model, we consider a simple yet highly practical problem - categorywise semantic segmentation. For this task, we build a light-weight architecture with just 10 M parameters. To further improve performance on under-represented classes with nuanced boundaries, we incorporate a boundary reÔ¨Ånement module. This module acts on different levels of the architecture, thatcontain progressively increasing amounts of information, again reminiscent of a pyramid. On the highly diverse and complex dataset, Berkeley Deep Drive, our composite architecture performs better than each of the individual modules.
